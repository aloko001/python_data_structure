    "Searching is a very basic necessity when you store data in different data structures. The simplest appraoch is to go across every element in the data structure and match it with the value you are searching for. This is known as Linear search. It is inefficient and rarely used, but creating a program for it gives an idea about how we can implement some advanced search algorithms."

    "This search algorithm works on the probing position of the required value. For this algorithm to work properly, the data collection should be in a sorted form and equally distributed. Initially, the probe position is the position of the middle most item of the collection.If a match occurs, then the index of the item is returned. If the middle item is greater than the item, then the probe position is again calculated in the sub-array to the right of the middle item. Otherwise, the item is searched in the subarray to the left of the middle item. This process continues on the sub-array as well until the size of subarray reduces to zero.\n",
